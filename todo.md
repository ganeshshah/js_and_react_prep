1. Rotate Array:
Given an array, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is a non-negative integer.
function rotateArray(arr, k) {
    // Write your code here
}

2. String Compression:
Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters. For example, the string "aabcccccaaa" would become "a2b1c5a3".
function compressString(str) {
    // Write your code here
}

3. Intersection of Two Arrays:
Given two arrays, write a function to compute their intersection.
function intersection(nums1, nums2) {
    // Write your code here
}

4. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters:
Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
function lengthOfLongestSubstring(s) {
    // Write your code here
}

5. Next Permutation:
Implement next permutation, which rearranges numbers into the lexicographically next greater permutation of numbers.
function nextPermutation(nums) {
    // Write your code here
}

6. Group Shifted Strings:
Given a string array, group strings that belong to the same shifting sequence.
function groupStrings(strings) {
    // Write your code here
}

7. Valid Sudoku:
Determine if a 9x9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the following rules:
// - Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
// - Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
// - Each of the 9 3x3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
function isValidSudoku(board) {
    // Write your code here
}

8. Longest Consecutive Sequence:
Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.
function longestConsecutive(nums) {
    // Write your code here
}

9. 3Sum:
Given an array nums of n integers, are there elements a, b, c in nums such that a + b + c = 0? Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.
function threeSum(nums) {
    // Write your code here
}

10.   Word Search:
Given an m x n grid of characters board and a string word, return true if word exists in the grid.
function exist(board, word) {
    // Write your code here
}

11.  Majority Element(Boyer-Moore Majority Voting Algorithm)

Boyer-Moore Majority Voting Algorithm Intuition

in a given array if we count all occurence of majority element and subtract vount of all minority elements we get a positive value.
which means that if we increment if a perticular element is found one after another, or decrement if not found in next index.

later we check if the majority element that we got   is greater the n/2 or not. greater means it is the majority element for sure.
