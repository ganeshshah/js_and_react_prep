## Array patterns

- Dynamic Array Manipulation: Includes basic array manipulations such as inserting, deleting, or updating elements. This category also includes challenges like rotating an array, finding a missing or duplicate number.
- Subarray Problems:
Maximum Subarray Problem: Finding a contiguous subarray with the maximum sum, often solved using Kadaneâ€™s Algorithm.
Subarray with a given sum: Includes finding subarrays that sum up to a target value.
- Sliding Window:
Fixed-size: Problems like finding the maximum sum of a subarray of a given size.
Variable-size: Problems like finding the longest substring without repeating characters or the smallest subarray with a sum greater than a given value.
- Two Pointer Technique:
Opposite direction: Used in problems like reversing an array, or for two-sum where elements in a sorted array sum up to a specific number.
Same direction: Often used in problems like removing duplicates from a sorted array or compressing an array based on certain criteria.
- Sorting and Searching:
Binary Search: Utilized in problems like searching in a rotated sorted array or finding the first and last position of an element in a sorted array.
Sorting: Problems that involve sorting arrays or using the properties of sorted arrays to simplify the problem, such as finding pairs with a specific sum.
- Hashing and Count:
Frequency count: Useful for problems like finding all duplicate numbers.
HashMap: For problems like finding subarrays with zero sum or grouping by frequency.
- Matrix Problems:
Spiral Order Traversal
Rotate Image: Rotating the matrix 90 degrees, flip operations.
Set Matrix Zeroes: Modifying the matrix based on conditions detected in an initial pass.
- Miscellaneous:
Stock Buy and Sell Problems: Maximizing profit from buying and selling stocks.
Interval Merging or Insertion: Merging overlapping intervals, inserting intervals into a list of non-overlapping intervals and merging if necessary.

### 10 most inmportant Patterns

1.  Two pointer
2.  Sliding windows (fixed,dynamic sized window)
3.  0/1 Knapsack Pattern
4.  Fast and Slow pointers pattern
5.  Merge intervals
6.  In-place reversal of a linked list
7.  Tree Breadth-First Search (BFS) - use queue datastructure, add parent then add childrens of it - from left to right after removing parent from the queue.
8.  Tree Deapth-First Search (DFS) - in-orded, pre-order, post-order.
9.  Subsets - dealing with Permutations and Combinations of a given set of elements.
10. Binary search and Modified binary search

If asked for all permutations/subsets then
- Backtracking

If given a tree then
- DFS
- BFS

If given a graph then
- DFS
- BFS

If given a linked list then
- Two pointers

If recursion is banned then
- Stack

If must solve in-place then
- Swap corresponding values
- Store one or more different values in the same pointer

If asked for maximum/minimum subarray/subset/options then
